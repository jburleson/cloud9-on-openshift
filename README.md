Cloud9 is a IDE created by Cloud9 IDE, Inc. (now owned wholly by Amazon Web Services) that uses HTML5 technologies to deliver a
coding experience in the cloud.

The following Dockerfiles allow Cloud9 to work on OpenShift - as traditional images won't work on OpenShift due to some limitations
(but not limted to):

- UIDs are scrambled, breaking usermode images even if done adequately. It still works but operates under a nonexisting UID.
- Root is prohibited due to security reasons (OpenShift Online).
- Mounting of volumes must be added with permissions adequately by making the target folder to where to mount the volume else it'll
  result in a OCI Runtime error (OpenShift Online).
